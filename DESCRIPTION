Description: Functions for parameter descriptions and operations in
    black-box optimization, tuning and machine learning. Parameters can be
    described (type, constraints, defaults, etc.), combined to parameter
    sets and can in general be programmed on. A useful OptPath object
    (archive) to log function evaluations is also provided.
